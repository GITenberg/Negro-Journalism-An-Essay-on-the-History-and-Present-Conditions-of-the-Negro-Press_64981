</div>

<p>This pamphlet does not pretend to be a detailed or scholarly
discussion of the subject. Lack of experience and funds have limited
the author to a mere outlining or suggesting of the field. In
fact, this essay is only the expansion of a term paper submitted
in fulfillment of a semester requirement in the Course in Journalism.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this essay is to show the various stages of
development through which the Negro press has evolved with a
view of furnishing a background for the better understanding of
its present status. It is written, too, to present the problems and
inherent possibilities of Negro Journalism; to point out the progress
which is being made today; and to suggest future possibilities. If
this attempt, amateur and incomplete as it may be, in any measure
awakens an interest in the achievements and efforts of Negro newspapers
and magazines it has served its purpose.</p>

<p>For the period up to 1890, the author frequently has referred
to <i>The Afro-American Press</i> and Its Editors by I. Garland Penn—a
work which is an authority on the subject for the period covered
by it. A large part of the biographical data and information on
present day newspapers was obtained from the Negro Year Book
and communications. I especially wish to thank those editors and
publishers who so kindly gave me the information which I desired.</p>

<p>I am also very grateful to The Chicago Defender and The Southern
Workman of Hampton, Va., for the loan of some cuts.</p>

<p>Especially do I wish to acknowledge the valuable assistance and
helpful criticism of my instructor, Prof. L. E. Mitchell, director
of the Course in Journalism, in DePauw University.</p>

<p>Seven years after Benjamin Lundy began
<i>The Genius of Universal Emancipation</i>, and
four years before William Lloyd Garrison
started to publish <i>The Liberator</i>, Negro Journalism in America was
born. The first publication was <i>Freedom’s Journal</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, issued March
16, 1827. It was in form a medium-sized, neat-looking, well-printed
weekly, about nine by twelve inches. <i>Freedom’s Journal</i> was a
thorough-going abolitionist sheet, having been called into being
to defend the Negro against the vile attacks of a New York editor
of Jewish descent who had pro-slavery and Negro-hating tendencies.
This new organ had for its motto, “Righteousness Exalteth a
Nation,” and its columns were filled with long dissertations on the
immorality of slavery.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">John Russwurm First Editor</span></div>

<p>The editor, John Russwurm, one of the first
Negroes to graduate from a college in the
United States, graduated from Bowdoin College
in 1826. Russwurm was born in Jamaica in 1799. He published
<i>The Journal</i> until 1829, when he went to Liberia, where he
became editor of <i>The Liberia Herald</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Colored American</span></div>

<p>A period of about eight years elapsed before
the founding of a second Negro newspaper.
In January, 1837, Rev. Samuel Cornish began
the publishing of <i>The Weekly Advocate</i>. The name was changed
in March, however, to <i>The Colored American</i>, and under that name
it continued to be issued weekly until 1842. The first editor, Rev.
Cornish, was one of the leading Negro journalists of the period.
He had been associated with <i>Freedom’s Journal</i>, and throughout a
period of twenty years he was actively connected with some newspaper.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Advocated Emancipation</span></div>

<p>The subscription price of <i>The Colored American</i>
was two dollars per year in advance.
Its objects were, according to its flag, “the
moral, social and political elevation of the free Colored people;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
and the peaceful emancipation of the enslaved.” The paper was
well received by the American press of the period, and many
favorable comments on it appeared from time to time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Elevator</span></div>

<p>The first two Negro newspapers had their
headquarters in New York City, but their
successor was established in Albany, N. Y. <i>The Elevator</i> came
into being in 1842, with Stephen Myers as its publisher. The paper
was strongly backed by the Abolitionists. Among its influential
supporters and backers was Horace Greeley of <i>The New York
Tribune</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The National Watchman</span></div>

<p>Contemporaneous with <i>The Elevator</i> appeared
<i>The National Watchman and Clarion</i>,
which was established in Troy, N. Y., in the
latter part of 1842. Its publisher and editor was William G. Allen.
It was short-lived, as was also <i>The People’s Press</i> which was published
by Thomas Hamilton in New York City the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Mystery</span></div>

<p>Following the lead taken by the empire state,
Pennsylvania became a field of activity for
the Negro journalist. In 1843, <i>The Mystery</i> was published at
Pittsburgh by Dr. Martin Delaney, a graduate of Harvard College.
At first it was conducted as the personal property of its editor,
but as such it survived only nine months when it became necessary
to transfer its ownership to a joint-stock company. After the change
Delaney was retained in the capacity of editor.</p>

<p>Delaney was the first Negro editor to be sued for libel. He was
fined for his statements; but his popularity was so great that the
fine was paid by popular subscription.</p>

<p><i>The Mystery</i> ceased publication under that name in 1848, at
which time it was purchased by the African Methodist Episcopal
Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Statement by N. Y. Sun, Origin of The Ram’s Horn</span></div>

<p>As the result of a statement by the editor of
<i>The New York Sun</i>, “The <i>Sun</i> shines for all
white men and not for colored men,” in
January, 1847, <i>The Ram’s Horn</i> was begun.
Its editor was Willis Hodges, who according to <i>The Afro-American
Press and Its Editor</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, furnished the money necessary to publish
the first issue by whitewashing in New York City for two months.
Within a short period of time the circulation of the paper reached
two thousand five hundred copies. The subscription price was
$1.50 to subscribers within the state, and $1 a year to those outside
the state. Its motto was—“We are men, and therefore interested
in whatever concerns men.” The publication was a five column
folio, printed on both sides. It suspended publication in June 1848.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Douglass Founds North Star</span></div>

<p>With the founding of the <i>North Star</i>, at
Rochester. N. Y., November 1, 1847, a new
era in Negro Journalism was begun. The
new paper was conducted on a much higher plane than any of the
preceding publications. The editor of the <i>North Star</i> was Frederick
Douglass, a man who stood head and shoulders above his colleagues.
In fact, Douglass is in Negro Journalism what Bennett, or Pulitzer,
or Greeley, or Dana is in American Journalism. The personal
fame of the man gave his paper at once a place among the first
journals of the country.</p>

<p>The columns of the <i>North Star</i> were filled with contributions
from correspondents in Europe and the West Indies, as well as
from all parts of the United States. It was the first Negro newspaper
to have any considerable circulation among the American
people outside of its own race group.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Life of Fred Douglass</span></div>

<p>The life of the founder of this paper is a
most interesting one. Born a slave at Tuckahoe,
Md., February, 1817, he escaped from
his master in 1833, going first to New York City, and then to New
Bedford, Mass. In 1841, he was sent out as a lecturer under the
auspices of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. He was one
of the most prominent anti-slavery agitators of his day; a series
of lectures on the immorality of human slavery was given by him
in England. Douglass’ power as a writer was great, and his ready
and vigorous use of the English language was always effective. The
paper was discontinued shortly after the abolition of slavery.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Impartial Citizen</span></div>

<p>Around the brilliancy of the <i>North Star</i>
moved several satellites, which somewhat
reflected the light of the major planet.
Among these was <i>The Impartial Citizen</i>, published at Syracuse,
N. Y., in 1848, by Samuel Ward. It is said that the paper was
conducted on a high plane and was ably edited.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Colored Man’s Journal Runs Ten Years</span></div>

<p>The suspension of <i>The Ram’s Horn</i> in 1848
left the Negroes of New York City without a
newspaper. However, in 1851, Louis H. Putman
began the publication of <i>The Colored
Man’s Journal</i>. It was backed by a friend who financially supported
it, and as a result the paper was able to run for a period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of ten years—a record unequalled during the period before the
Emancipation by any paper with the exception of the <i>North Star</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Alienated American</span></div>

<p><i>The Alienated American</i>, edited by W. H.
Day, was the first Negro newspaper published
in Ohio. It entered upon its career in Cleveland,
Ohio, in 1852, five years after its editor was graduated from
Oberlin College. <i>The Alienated American</i> was one of the best
journals published by Negroes in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Day was a prolific, scholarly writer. His publication was a
creditable one and realized a good support. The paper ceased
publication in 1856, when its editor made a trip to England.</p>

<p>In 1848, the African Methodist Episcopal
Church purchased <i>The Mystery</i> of Pittsburgh,
Pa., of which Martin Delaney was editor.
During the four years of its existence in Pittsburgh, the paper
was known as the <i>Christian Herald</i>. In 1852, the paper was moved
to Philadelphia, and its name was changed to <i>Christian Recorder</i>.
Rev, M. M. Clarke became its first editor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Christian Recorder Oldest Negro Newspaper</span></div>

<p>The beginning of the <i>Christian Recorder</i> in
1852, marks the founding of the oldest Negro
newspaper in existence today. It is also
significant in that it marks the first serious
attempt in Negro Journalism to establish a religious newspaper.
The early years of the paper were beset with many difficulties, and
oftimes the paper was not issued regularly. Not until Elisha
Weaver became editor in 1861 did it appear weekly. The size of
the paper has increased from 5 columns, 4 pages, 12 by 16 inches,
in 1848, to its present size, 4 columns, 16 pages, 10 by 16 inches.</p>

<p>The present circulation of the paper is about 5,000. Its editor
is R. R. Wright Jr., who received the degree of Ph.D. from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1911.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Negro Journalism on Pacific Coast</span></div>

<p>The year 1855 saw Negro Journalism starting
on the Pacific coast. Within a space of less
than thirty years Negro Journalism had made
its way from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboard. The first publication
was established at San Francisco under the name of <i>The
Mirror of the Times</i>. Its editor was Judge Gibbs. It was published
for seven years, and in 1862 was merged into <i>The Pacific Appeal</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Herald of Freedom</span></div>

<p>Another contemporary of the <i>North Star</i> was
<i>The Herald of Freedom</i>, published in 1855,
in Ohio, by Peter H. Clark. It was short-lived
but during its existence it was one of the best advocates of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Abolition. Its editor was a man of good common sense and vast
knowledge. After the suspension of his paper, Clark was associated
with Douglass on the <i>North Star</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Anglo-African</span></div>

<p>Thomas Hamilton, the publisher of the short-lived
<i>People’s Press</i>, again attempted a
publication in New York City. On July 23,
1859, he began publishing <i>The Anglo-African</i>. The paper was
well printed and in the opinion of Frederick Douglass “had more
promise and more journalistic ability about it, than any of the
other papers.” The motto of the papers of the period was highly
indicative of their editorial outlook and policy. Practically every
paper had its motto, and <i>The Anglo-African</i> was no exception. Its
motto was: “Man must be free; if not through law, then above
the law.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Advocates Haytian Emigration</span></div>

<p>In 1860, the paper was bought by James
Redpath—the object of his purchase being
to advocate the Haytian Emigration Movement.
With the change in ownership the paper was known as
<i>The Weekly Anglo-African</i>. Later, in 1861, the paper reverted to
the Hamilton family, being published by Robert Hamilton. The
original name of the paper was resumed, and under its new publisher
became an ardent supporter of the Republican party. With
the freeing of the slaves, <i>The Anglo-African</i> began to advocate the
need of educational facilities for the freedman, especially in the
South. The paper was suspended shortly after Emancipation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Colored Citizen Organ of Negro Soldiers During War</span></div>

<p>During the period of the Civil War only two
Negro newspapers were established, one of
which was <i>The Colored Citizen</i>, published at
Cincinnati, Ohio, by John P. Sampson. It
was issued in the interest of the Negro
soldiers fighting in the war. It was commonly referred to as the
“Soldiers’ Organ,” and was widely disseminated among the soldiers.
Sampson was well educated—being a product of the Boston public
school system—and as an editor he was both able and enterprising.
<i>The Colored Citizen</i> was suspended the latter part of 1865.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Pacific Appeal</span></div>

<p>In 1862, <i>The Pacific Appeal</i> came into being
in San Francisco, but it was not a new
publication, however, it was merely the successor
to <i>The Mirror of the Times</i>. Its editor was William H.
Carter. It became the index of the activities of the Negroes on
the Pacific coast. The paper’s motto was: “He who would be
free, himself must strike the blow.” It was a six column folio,
well-printed, and contained editorials which on the whole were
sober and sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Elevator, Edited by Bell</span></div>

<p>The second paper established on the western
coast was <i>The Elevator</i>, which was begun by
Phillip Bell, April 18, 1865, in San Francisco,
Cal. The paper stated its mission thus: “We shall labor
for the civil and political enfranchisement of the Colored people—not
as a distinct and separate race, but as American citizens.” The
publisher encouraged advertisements and quoted his rates as being
60 cents for one insertion and 25 cents for each subsequent insertion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Bell a Man of Learning</span></div>

<p>Bell had been connected with the journalistic
field for twenty-five years, and as a result
was experienced in the work. His editorials
were of a high quality. His paper was neatly printed and contained
contributions relating to science, art, literature and drama.
In fact, it is said that Bell himself was well-versed in belles-lettres
and dramatic criticism. By many of his contemporaries he was
considered the Napoleon of the Negro press. Although he died in
1889, his paper continued for many years thereafter.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Emancipation Goal of Negro Press</span></div>

<p>With the emancipation, a new period in
Negro Journalism is begun. For nearly forty
years newspapers had been published by
Negroes who had obtained their freedom, but
the circulation of these papers among the race group of necessity
was limited. Emancipation marked the realization of the goal of
the Negro press prior to that time, and with the ushering in of freedom
many of the newspapers ceased publication. There was, however,
still another great, if not even more important task for the
Negro press—the education of the masses of illiterate. This task
the surviving newspapers, together with many new ones, set out
to accomplish.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Southern Negro Newspaper</span></div>

<p>The first notable development of the period
was the beginning of Negro newspapers in
the South, where the large majority of
Negroes were located. The first Negro newspaper published in the
South was <i>The Colored American</i> of Augusta, Ga., issued for the
first time in October, 1865. The following paragraph from its
prospectus will suffice to show the paper’s attitude and policy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Colored American’s Prospectus</span></div>

<p>“It (<i>The Colored American</i>) is designated to
be a vehicle for the diffusion of Religious,
Political and General Intelligence. It will
be devoted to the promotion of harmony and
good-will between the whites and Colored people of the south, and
untiring in its advocacy of Industry and Education among all
classes; but particularly the class most in need of our agency.</p>

<p>“Accepting, at all times, the decision of public sentiment and
Legislative Assemblies, and bowing to the majesty of law, it will
fearlessly remonstrate against legal and constitutional proscription
by appeal to the public sense of justice.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Shuften’s Editorial on the Race Problem</span></div>

<p>The editor of the paper was J. T. Shuften,
who was ably assisted by Dr. James Lynch.
Shuften was credited by <i>The New York

the time on the “Negro Question.” The paper was short-lived and
suspended February, 1866.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Precursors in Southern States</span></div>

<p>With the beginning of Negro Journalism in
the South, papers sprung up in other states:
<i>The Colored Tennessean</i> and <i>The True Communicator</i>,
of Baltimore, Md., being among the more noted ones.
Many of the papers were short-lived; others changed hands and
names frequently and continued for several years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Papers Grow in Influence and Circulation</span></div>

<p>The year 1868 saw the founding of <i>The
Charleston Leader</i>, at Charleston, S. C. By
1870, the Negro press began to make itself
felt. <i>The People’s Journal</i>, with a circulation
of over 10,000 was being edited by Dr. R. L. Perry. In
Mississippi, James J. Spellman and John Lynch began <i>The Colored
Citizen</i>. December, 1870, marked the founding of <i>The New Orleans
Louisianian</i>, by P. B. S. Pinchback<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, who in 1873 became
governor of Louisiana, being the only Negro ever to hold this
position.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Editors Highly Educated</span></div>

<p>August 1861, John J. Freeman started <i>The Progressive American</i>,
in New York City, which existed for ten years. The one outstanding
achievement of this paper is the fact that as a result of its fight
for Negro teachers in the public schools twenty-three were appointed.
Between 1865 and 1880, over 30 newspapers
of more or less merit came into existence;
Negro newspapers were being published in
21 states. The papers of the period were ably edited and were the
product of some of the most highly educated Negroes.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Number of Papers Increases</span></div>

<p>The last twenty years of the nineteenth century
were marked by an increase in the number
of papers published. More than 150
papers were being published by Negroes in thirty different states
before the dawn of the new century. To trace the history of all
of these papers would be useless, if not well nigh impossible, as
but few of them were long-lived or permanent. Most of them were
started for the achievement of a single end, and having served the
temporary need disappeared. There are, however, several papers
which were established during this period that demand treatment
because of their longevity and present existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Philadelphia Tribune</span></div>

<p>Among this group is <i>The Philadelphia Tribune</i>,
founded by Christopher J. Perry in
1884. Perry, who was sole owner of his
paper, had had much experience in Journalism before becoming
a publisher. His work as editor of the Colored Department of
<i>The Sunday Mercury</i>, had established his reputation as a journalist.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Remarkable Success Under Perry</span></div>

<p>Since its founding, its editor has worked unceasingly
towards its development and as a
result the success of the paper has been
remarkable. Today the paper exists, and
in spite of the death of its founder in 1920, is still
carried on by his heirs. Today <i>The Philadelphia Tribune</i> occupies
an enviable position among Negro papers, and is undoubtedly one
of the twelve best Negro papers in the United States. At the time
of his death, Christopher Perry was president of The National
Negro Press Association.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Age Oldest Negro Paper in New York City</span></div>

<p>The oldest Negro newspaper published in
New York City at the present time is <i>The
New York Age</i>. It was founded in 1888 by
T. Thomas Fortune, the living dean of Negro
newspaper editors. Fortune began his journalistic career as a
boy in the office of a white paper published in Marianna, Fla. His
first editorship came in 1880, when he became connected with
<i>The New York Globe</i>. Under the guidance of Fortune, <i>The Age</i>
was perhaps the greatest Negro newspaper of the period. Garland
Penn, in his <i>Afro-American Press</i> (published in 1891), styles,
Fortune as “the most noted man in Afro-American journalism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Richmond Planet Edited by Mitchell</span></div>

<p><i>The Richmond Planet</i>, founded by John Mitchell,
Jr., in 1884, is another Negro newspaper
that has enjoyed longevity. Mitchell
seems to have been a born newspaperman,
and practically all of his life he has devoted himself to journalism.
Despite his location in the Southland, Mitchell has ever been a
bold and fearless writer. Today <i>The Richmond Planet</i> still exists,
with John Mitchell, Jr., at its head, and has a circulation of over
25,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Smith and The Cleveland Gazette</span></div>

<p><i>The Cleveland Gazette</i> was begun in August,
1883, with H. C. Smith as sole owner. It
was considered as one of the best edited
papers in the United States. Smith was an ardent politician, and
his editorials advocating Republicanism were exceptionally pointed
and well put. The paper was one of the few Negro papers of the
period that was a financial success. <i>The Cleveland Gazette</i> is still
published by H. C. Smith. It has a circulation of approximately
20,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">William Chase and The Bee</span></div>

<p>Perhaps the strongest Negro newspaper ever
published in Washington, D. C., is <i>The
Washington Bee</i>, of which William Calvin
Chase is editor and founder. Chase is especially noted for his
bull-dog tenacity in exposing and attacking fraud. He has always
been one of the “big guns” in editorial artillery. Chase is still
editor of his paper, and <i>The Bee</i> buzzes as of old.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Freeman First Illustrated Negro Weekly</span></div>

<p>The first illustrated Negro newspaper was
<i>The Indianapolis Freeman</i>, founded by Edward
Cooper of Indianapolis, Ind., July 14,
1888. The paper consisted of eight pages,
and gave a complete review of the doings of Negroes everywhere.
The extensive use of cuts and illustrations made the paper famous.
As an all around newspaperman, Cooper was without a peer, and
under his management the paper reached a pre-eminent position
in Negro Journalism. Today <i>The Freeman</i> is owned and controlled
by George L. Knox, and it still enjoys a wide range of popularity.
The paper features theatricals and sports. The present circulation
is about 30,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Afro-American Founded in 1893</span></div>

<p>The founding of <i>The Afro-American</i> in 1893,
by W. M. Alexander marks the beginning of
a paper which today figures most conspicuously
in Negro Journalism. About 1896, the paper came into the
hands of J. H. Murphy, Sr.,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who is now its managing editor at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>

<span class="smaller">THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA (1900-⸺)</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Journalism Becoming a Profession</span></div>

<p>Without doubt the first two decades of the
twentieth century mark the highest progress
in Negro Journalism. More papers have
been established, and better papers have been
produced. A realization of the power of the press has grown as
the period of freedom has increased and race consciousness has
been developed. More men with capital have invested in newspapers.
Publishers and editors began for the first time to consider
Journalism a profession from which a living could be derived.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Lack Funds and Need Equipment</span></div>

<p>Lack of adequate funds to fully develop a
well-balanced newspaper has been and still
is the greatest drawback to the Negro publisher.
Until in very recent years, no Negro newspaper did all of
its mechanical work. In many cases the newspaper office merely
collected and arranged the news, and then carried it to some publishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
concern. In other cases, the paper was printed by a publishing
house, although the “forms” were made-up in the paper’s
own shop. Thus, Negro newspapers have not been independent
concerns.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Lack of Live News Stories</span></div>

<p>In his effort to seriously make journalistic
progress, the publisher of a Negro newspaper
has always found it difficult to obtain sufficient
live material to fill up his sheet. There have been no news
bureaus or syndicates to supply him with the type of news needed
to make his paper a real newsy sheet. In his endeavor to “pad out”
in order to continually fill the standard size of his paper, the Negro
publisher has been compelled to “clip” news previously featured
by the daily newspapers or rewrite news from other Negro papers—a
task rendered difficult by the corresponding dearth of real news
in all Negro papers during “dull” seasons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Poor Organization a Serious Handicap</span></div>

<p>Prior to and at the beginning of the twentieth
century, the organization of the average
Negro newspaper amounted to a printer-editor,
perhaps an assistant whose duties were varied and manifold,
an office girl, who in addition to keeping books, also performed
the duties of copy-reader, and two or three agents who worked
part time on a percentage basis. The typographical and grammatical
structure of many of the papers suffered greatly through the
lack of having a staff sufficiently trained and equipped with the
proper facilities for turning out a well-edited, well-printed sheet.</p>

<p>Dependence on a small, under-paid and inefficient organization—a
condition analogous, and in many instances worse than that which
exists on the small town newspaper—has seriously handicapped
the Negro newspaper of the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">News Bureaus and Syndicates Founded</span></div>

<p>The past twenty years have witnessed the
evolution of a new Negro press. Stronger
papers have been begun, and news syndicates
and news associations have been founded.
Examples of the latter are: The Hampton Institute
Service, The Tuskegee Institute Press Service, Allen’s News Agency,
The R. W. Thompson News Agency, The National Negro Press
Association and The Associated Negro Press. Especially is the
last named organization rendering a great service and filling a great
need.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Associated Negro Press</span></div>

<p>The Associated Negro Press has been in
existence less than four years but during that
time it has rapidly grown and achieved great
success. Today it has a membership of more than 100 newspapers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
The establishment of the A. N. P. was the first effort in Negro
Journalism to assemble and distribute regularly general news from
all sections of the United States and other countries affecting Colored
people. Through the work of this organization big news
stories now appear simultaneously in all of the leading Negro newspapers.
The A. N. P. maintains executive offices in Chicago and
permanent bureaus in Washington and New York.</p>

<p>Negro newspaper offices are being transformed

<i>The Chicago Defender</i>, one of the leading Negro newspapers, moved
into a new building fitted up by its owner, Robert S. Abbott, at an

favorably with that of any paper of its size in the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Its equipment includes four linotype machines, each equipped with
two magazines, geared to cast seven lines per minute. The press
on which <i>The Defender</i> is printed is a 32-page and color machine,
made by the celebrated Goss Printing Press Company. It is driven
by a 30 H.P. motor and six men are required for its operation.
It prints, folds and counts the papers all in one operation at a
speed of 35,000 copies per hour. The paper’s circulation is over

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sectional Differences in Development</span></div>

<p>Papers printed in different parts of the
country vary quite significantly in their make-up
and quality. The best papers are probably
published in the Middle West and the
East. The Southern press is still in the rear, although signs are
evident that it is beginning to wake up. At the present four Southern
papers have a very high national rating. They are <i>The Afro-American</i>,
<i>The Atlanta Independent</i>, <i>The Nashville Globe</i> and <i>The
Dallas Express</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Papers Having Over 30,000</span></div>

<p>Seven papers have over 30,000 subscribers.
The list includes the following papers in the
order named: <i>The Chicago Defender</i>, <i>The
Negro World</i>, <i>The Indianapolis Ledger</i>, <i>The Atlanta Independent</i>,
<i>The New York News</i>, <i>The Pittsburgh Courier</i> and <i>The Birmingham
Reporter</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Twelve Leading Negro Weeklies</span></div>

<p>Any attempt to select the leading Negro newspapers
of necessity must be more or less
arbitrary, and dependent upon prejudices
toward certain types of journalism. A probable list of the best
twelve weeklies might include: <i>The Chicago Defender</i>, <i>The Afro-American</i>,
<i>The Cleveland Advocate</i>, <i>The Philadelphia Tribune</i>, <i>The
New York Age</i>, <i>The Pittsburgh Courier</i>, <i>The Chicago Whip</i>, <i>The
St. Louis Argus</i>, <i>The Indianapolis Ledger</i>, <i>The Atlanta Independent</i>,
<i>The Detroit Leader</i> and <i>The Boston Guardian</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">DAILY NEGRO NEWSPAPERS</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Daily Cairo Gazette</span></div>

<p>The first attempt of the Negro journalist to
publish a daily newspaper was <i>The Cairo</i>
(Ill.) <i>Gazette</i>, which was first issued April 23,
1882. The editor was W. S. Scott. The paper was issued regularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
for six months when the plant was destroyed by fire. It was
a readable sheet, contained much original matter, and had a good
force of reporters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Columbus Messenger</span></div>

<p>The next attempt was <i>The Columbus Messenger</i>,
published at Columbus. Ga. It was
first issued as a daily in 1888. It was edited
by B. T. Harvey, a graduate of Tuskegee Institute. The sheet was
12 by 20 inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dailies Issued for Short Periods</span></div>

<p>Several newspapers have issued daily editions
for short periods. <i>The Knoxville</i>
(Tenn.) <i>Negro World</i> was issued daily as
an advertising medium for two weeks. About 1890 <i>The Public
Ledger</i> of Baltimore, Md., was issued daily by Wesley Adams, for
a short period. <i>The Nashville Globe</i> published a daily during the
$30,000 Y. M. C. A. campaign in Nashville, Tenn., June 1-12, 1913.
It proved a tremendous success for the twelve days and had an
average circulation of 5,000 per day. During the World War
<i>The Herald</i> of Baltimore, Md., edited by W. T. Andrews, was issued
daily.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dailies in Form of “Broadsides”</span></div>

<p>Three daily papers are being published at
present. Two of these, <i>The Richmond</i> (Va.)
<i>Colored American</i> and <i>The Washington Colored
American</i> are published by the American Publicity Bureau,
Inc. and The National Negro Publicity Bureau, Inc., respectively
with D. Eugene Taylor listed as general manager of both. In form
these papers are “broadsides”—a bulletin type of sheet printed on
only one side. They are printed on a sheet measuring 24 inches
by 36 inches. The news is set in two double columns, running
down the center of the page between a double column of advertising
on each side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Daily Standard</span></div>

<p>The third paper is <i>The Indianapolis Daily
Standard</i> which began publication the latter
part of April, 1922, under the editorship of
C. C. Shelby. It is a 7 column, 4-page paper and retails at 2 cents
per copy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Drawbacks to Negro Daily</span></div>

<p>The slow development of the Negro daily is
due chiefly to the fact: (1) That the field
of such papers is already covered to a large
extent by the American daily press; and (2) That a daily paper,
with a restricted field from which to gather news, and denied the
service of the Associated Press, is well nigh impossible. With the
further development of the Associated Negro Press more Negro
dailies may be possible.</p>

<span class="smaller">NEGRO MAGAZINES</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Early Magazines</span></div>

<p>The magazine field has not been entered as
rapidly or as fully by the Negro journalist
as the newspaper field. The first Negro
magazine, nevertheless, early followed the beginning made by the
first Negro newspaper. In 1837, the first magazine—<i>The Mirror
of Liberty</i>—was published by David Ruggles. It was devoted to
the advancement of the free Negroes in the North, and was issued
quarterly from New York City.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Anglo-African Magazine</span></div>

<p>The next serious attempt to publish a Negro
magazine was in 1856, when Thomas Hamilton,
of New York City, issued <i>The Anglo-African
Magazine</i>, which was the outgrowth of his newspaper, The
Anglo-African. It was devoted to literature, science, statistics and
contained articles on the abolition of slavery. It existed for about
four years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A. M. E. Review Oldest Magazine</span></div>

<p>The oldest Negro magazine, like the oldest
newspaper, was established by the A. M. E.
Church. In 1884, that denomination began
the publishing of <i>The A. M. E. Review</i> in Baltimore, Md. Today
it still exists and is published in Philadelphia, Pa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Our Women and Children</span></div>

<p>Another noteworthy periodical is <i>Our Women
and Children</i>, first published in 1888, by Dr.
William J. Simmons. It was unique in that
it practically confined itself to the feminine world. Its contributors
were chiefly women and the articles which appeared on its pages
concerned themselves primarily with questions which affected home-life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Over 100 Magazines in Existence</span></div>

<p>Many other Negro magazines have been attempted;
many of more or less note, but of
the magazines established prior to 1900,
scarcely a one, if any, are in existence today.
Of the leading present day magazines, none can boast of as long
a period of publication as the present day newspapers. At present
about one hundred magazines are being published by Negroes.
However, this number includes school periodicals, church organs
and fraternal organs, and only a small fraction of the total number
are purely literary or secular publications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Crisis Edited by Dr. DuBois</span></div>

<p>Among the foremost Negro magazines of
general literature is <i>The Crisis</i>, published at
New York City, under the editorship of Dr.
W. E. B. DuBois, perhaps the leading literary figure among the
race today. While the publication is the official organ of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, it
contains short stories, essays, sketches and poetry of a high literary
quality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Special Educational Number</span></div>

<p>A special feature of <i>The Crisis</i> is the emphasis
it places on higher education. Each
July it publishes an educational number containing
the photographs of Negro college
graduates from white Northern institutions during the past school
year. The issue also contains a resume of the educational progress
of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Messenger, a Journal of Social Science</span></div>

<p><i>The Messenger</i>, published in New York City
by Phillip Randolph and Chandler Owen, is
devoted to economic, political and sociological
subject-matter, with special emphasis
upon the Negro and his relation to the labor problem. The tremendous
influence of this magazine, devoted as it is to such a
special field, is clearly shown by the fact that at present it has a
circulation of over 26,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Magazine Devoted to Music and Sports</span></div>

<p>Another magazine which confines itself to a
limited field is <i>The American Musician and
Sportsman Magazine</i>. This publication is
printed in Philadelphia, Pa., by William A.
Potter, editor. It is intended to afford opportunity for the expression
of opinion on things musical, and in addition to its
emphasis on music it deals with all branches of professional and
amateur sports. The magazine has a circulation of 5500.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Journal of Negro History</span></div>

<p>One of the most scholarly periodicals published
by Negroes is <i>The Journal of Negro
History</i> edited by Carter G. Woodson, Ph.D.,
at Washington, D. C. The publication treats in a thorough-going
and detailed manner the history of the Negro race.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Brownies’ Book for Negro Youth</span></div>

<p><i>The Brownies’ Book</i>, a magazine devoted to
the activities of the Negro youth, is also
published in New York City and has at its
head Dr. DuBois and Augustus Dill. It contains stories, the life
and deeds of famous men and women of the Negro race, and current
events of the world told in language suitable for children.
In a similar manner to <i>The Crisis</i>, it features the photographs
of Negro high school graduates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Featured Negro Short Stories</span></div>

<p>Two magazines of national importance and
published in Chicago, Ill., are <i>The Half-Century</i>,
edited by Katherine Williams Irmin
and <i>The Favorite</i>, edited by Fenton Johnson. Both of these periodicals
feature literary material and short stories dealing with
Negro life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Radiator</span></div>

<p>Another periodical dealing with a special
field is <i>The Radiator</i>, a bi-monthly insurance
magazine, edited by Sadie T. Mossell at Durham, N. C. Its purpose
is to disseminate news and information to Negro insurance
companies and workers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Leading Present Day Magazines</span></div>

<p>Other magazines published at the present
time are: <i>The Journal of the National Medical
Association</i>, issued quarterly by the
National Medical Association at Tuskegee Institute, Ala.; <i>The Pullman
Porter’s Review</i>, Chicago, Ill.; <i>The Search Light</i>, Raleigh,
N. C.; <i>The Rainbow</i>, New York City, and <i>The Crusader</i>, New York
City.</p>

<span class="smaller">TRAINING IN NEGRO SCHOOLS</span></h2>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Elementary Training in High Schools</span></div>

<p>Definite steps are being taken by Negro
schools and colleges to provide academic
training in Journalism. Even in the high
schools, the development of a vague appreciation
of, and elementary training in Journalism is afforded by the
publishing of school papers, under the supervision of the English
department. Such schools as Dunbar High School, Washington,
D. C.; Summer High School, St. Louis, Mo.; Central High School,
Louisville, Ky.; Pearl High School, Nashville, Tenn., and Langston
High School, Hot Springs, Ark., illustrate the point.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">College Publications</span></div>

<p>What is true of the high schools is true of
the Normal and Industrial schools and colleges
on a larger scale. Approximately one
hundred periodicals are published by such institutions at least once
a month. Some of these are purely the product of the student
body; a few of them are the product of both students and faculty;
still others are the publication of the administration and faculty,
and under the supervision of a university editor. Many of the
latter have developed to the place where they are nationally known.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Such periodicals as <i>The Fisk University News</i>, <i>The Southern Workman</i>
(Hampton Institute), <i>Howard University Record</i> (quarterly),
<i>The Tuskegee Student</i> and <i>The Atlanta University Bulletin</i> (quarterly)
are among the best Negro publications in the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Journalism Courses at Fisk University</span></div>

<p>This, however, is not all. The training of
Negro journalists is being attempted through
college courses. Fisk University, Nashville,
Tenn., perhaps, was the first school to give
such courses. Under the professorship of Isaac Fisher, one of the
foremost Negro editors today, four courses in Journalism are
offered. The course as outlined in the latest Fisk University catalog
includes: (1) Essentials in Newspaper Technique—a course
including practise in writing, editing, and methods of presentation;
(2) The Law of Journalism—a study of libel, copyright, rights
and duties of the press in reporting judicial proceedings, and the
liabilities of the publisher, editor, reporter and contributor; (3)
Ethics of Journalism—lectures discussing the proper responsibility
to the public on the part of newspaper writers; (4) Art of Newspaper
and Magazine Making—a course devoted to the studying of
actual work of making a newspaper and magazine, with laboratory
practice to supplement the theory studied.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Professional Training</span></div>

<p>What will in all probabilities mark the real
beginning of professional training in Journalism
among Negroes is the opening of the
proposed School of Journalism by Howard University, Washington,
D. C. Owing to a limitation of finances, unfortunately the
school has not yet been put in operation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Proposed Courses at Howard University Journalism School</span></div>

<p>The course as outlined in the Howard University
catalog is based upon two years of
college work, including a reading knowledge
of at least two modern languages, and advanced
work in English Composition. The
professional work covers two years and leads to the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Journalism. The subjects offered are:
Practice in Writing, Newspaper Technique, Newspaper Editing, The
History of Journalism, Advertising, Journalistic French, Journalistic
German, Journalistic Spanish, Elements of Law, Freehand and
Applied Drawing, and certain college courses in History, Economics,
Sociology, Literature and Politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Journalism at Wilberforce</span></div>

<p>While it does not have a separate department
in Journalism, Wilberforce University offers
courses in journalistic writing as a part of
the work in the department of English. Three courses are given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
at present: Business English, Short Story Writing and Editorial
Writing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Printing</span></div>

<p>On the mechanical side of newspaper publishing,
work is offered in printing at Hampton
Institute (Va.), Tuskegee Institute (Ala.), and Wilberforce
University (Ohio). Many of the present printer-editors are products
of these schools.</p>

<span class="smaller">A FORECAST OF THE FUTURE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>From its small beginning in 1827, Negro Journalism has steadily
grown in the United States. Today it stands as a definite factor
in Negro life. In truth, the Negro press reflects the growing race
consciousness of eleven million American citizens of African descent.
The status of the Negro newspaper is fixed—it is here to stay.
While daily newspapers may devote space to “News of Interest to
Colored People;” yet they can never take the place of the newspapers
which are published solely for the race group. The appeal
of the Negro newspaper is direct and racial. In a manner similar
to that of the rural press, the Negro paper has an unlimited field
because of its personal relationship to its readers.</p>

<p>During the first half century of Negro Journalism, it is doubtful
if any of the papers were financial successes; in truth, most of them
were published as purely partisan or propagandists organs, and
were supported through the contributions of sympathizers. Today
Negro newspapers are conducted on business principles and pay
reasonable returns to their investors.</p>

<p>Papers in the large cities have built up enormous subscription
lists of bona fide, paid-up subscribers. Likewise, they carry a large
amount of well-paying advertisements, and as a result of these
sources of income they are able to give attractive remuneration
to their publishers, editorial staff and business staff. No longer
must the Negro journalist necessarily be an unpaid worker.
Trained journalists can obtain respectable salaries and find as many
openings as their fellow workers on metropolitan dailies and
national weeklies and monthlies.</p>

<p>That the calibre of the work done on Negro publications will
continue to improve is highly probable in view of the fact that
every year an increasing number of trained young men and women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
are entering the field, and bringing with them burning enthusiasm
and high professional ideals. The Courses in Journalism in the
Negro colleges, also, will soon be having a telling effect on the
future Negro journalist. Already a few of the twentieth century
Negro youths are being attracted to the professional study of Journalism,
preferring the possibilities of its virgin field to the overcrowded
professions of law, teaching, medicine and theology.</p>

<p>The future of Negro Journalism is limited only by the zeal and
conscientious effort which its workers bestir themselves to exert.
A marvelous growth and success has been recorded within the past
95 years, but greater achievement is yet to be accomplished. Negro
semi-weeklies, and eventually dailies in the larger cities, will undoubtedly
be developed within the next decade. The size of many
of the present weeklies will be increased of necessity. Better news
stories and more real news will be the result of the successful functioning
of such news syndicates as the Associated Negro Press.</p>

<p>The decreasing of illiteracy among the Negroes will continue to
be carried forward by the Negro press, with a mutual benefit to
the race and its publications. Higher standards of literacy will
bring greater appreciation for reading and thereby create a stronger
support for the Negro publisher.</p>

<p>In the immediate future, perhaps, the great field for development
in Negro Journalism is in the South where the great mass of Negro
population, despite the Northern immigration, resides. There Negro
Journalism needs and will continue to need its best trained editors
and managers. There it will need men of sound judgment and
common sense; men of purpose and high professional ideals; men
of broad sympathy and great patience.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
